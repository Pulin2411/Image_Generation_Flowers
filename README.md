                                          ðŸŒ¸ Flower Classification using CNN

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates image classification on a flower dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow/Keras.
The notebook explores:

Loading and preprocessing images

Data augmentation

Building CNN architectures

Hyperparameter tuning (filters, hidden layers, dropout)

Preventing overfitting with regularization and early stopping

Model evaluation and visualization

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is 5 Flower Types Classification Dataset
.
It contains images of 5 flower categories, used for training and validation.

Loaded via kagglehub into the notebook.

Preprocessing handled with ImageDataGenerator (rescaling, augmentation, train/validation split).

Main steps:

Data Preparation â€“ Load and augment dataset

Model Building â€“ Define CNN with tunable hyperparameters

Training â€“ Train multiple configurations

Evaluation â€“ Plot accuracy/loss curves, compare models

Prediction â€“ Run inference on test images

ðŸ§  Model Architectures

The notebook explores multiple CNN configurations:

Conv2D â†’ MaxPooling â†’ Dense layers

Variable filters: 32, 64

Variable hidden layers: 1, 2

Dropout rates tested: 0.3, 0.5

EarlyStopping callback used for overfitting control
